  	<h1>My Basketball Career</h1>

  	<p>I started playing basketball when I was 8 years old. The first league I played in was a recreational league in alpharetta. I then moved on to play for my middleschool feeder team. When I was in the seventh grade, our team won the championship for the league our feeder team was in, only losing one game. The following year, I played on the JV team. Then I transitioned to highscool. I started on the varsity freshamn year all the way through my senior year. Pictured above is my friend Devin and me, The night that picture was taken, the two of us outscored the <mark>entire other team</mark> by ourselves, and I broke the record for <abbr>most 3's</abbr> made in a single game.</p>

  	<p>The above picture is of my first AAU team. This is where I truly developed into the player than I became. We were based out of the city of atlanta. I learned how to play a whole different style of basketball by playing with this team. It definitley was the most important thing I did to develop myself as a player. </p>
